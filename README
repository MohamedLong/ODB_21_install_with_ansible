First : Setting Up Passwordless SSH for Ansible on Debian-Based Systems
1. Update the system and install OpenSSH server:
    - sudo apt update -y
    - sudo apt install openssh-server -y
2. Enable and start the SSH service:
    - sudo systemctl enable ssh
    - sudo systemctl start ssh
3. Generate an SSH key pair for Ansible:
    - ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "ansible"
4. List the contents of the .ssh directory to verify the key generation:
    - ls -la ~/.ssh
5. Copy the public key to the target server (192.168.56.101):
    - ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub user@192.168.56.101
6. Test passwordless SSH connection from the Ansible control node:
    - ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa user@192.168.56.101
